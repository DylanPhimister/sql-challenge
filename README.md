SQL CHALLENGE

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

I used the Xpert Learning Assistant, ChatGPT, and a similar project (https://github.com/rraja30/sql-challenge.git) to get help get started and get help on the inner joins of the tables.
